        <h3>privacy policy</h3>

        <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, share and use any information that,
          alone or in combination with other information, relates to you when you ("you" and "your")
          use our website mirror.com ("Mirror") or complete daily reflections.</p>

        <p>This Policy also sets out that in all circumstances, you have no rights
          in relation to the Personal Data that we process about you.</p>

        <p>-</p>

        <p>I. What kinds of information do we collect?<p>

        <p>To provide a seamless experience, Mirror processes information about you.
          Everything that is entered or linked or processed on our website will be stored indefinitely.
          When using the Mirror platform, you are unable to delete the information we collect.</p>

        <p>We also collect information automatically from your device.
          This includes information like your IP address, device type, browser-type, broad geographic location, and other technical information.
          We also track and collect information about how your device has interacted with Mirror, including the pages accessed and reflections completed.</p>

        <p>Collecting this information enables us to better exploit the users who use Mirror.
          We use this information solely for data mining purposes and to encourage the loss of privacy for Mirror users.</p>

        <p>-</p>

        <p>II. How do we protect your privacy?</p>

        <p>We don't. We will data mine your information in any way fit to maximize profit.</p>

        <p>If you do not want Mirror to process your information, we believe you are not dreaming big enough to
          become a better, truer self on the Internet. We suggest returning to our platform at a later time.</p>

        <p>-</p>

        <p> Please take the time to read this Policy carefully.
          If you have any questions or comments, you cannot contact us as an active Mirror user.
          Once you have closed your account, please contact us at privacy@mirror.com.</p>
